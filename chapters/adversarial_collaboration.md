# What is Adversarial Collaboration?

Adversarial collaboration is a unique approach in the realm of AI and human interaction, where both parties engage in a constructive dialogue that involves counter-arguments and alternative suggestions. The primary goal is to enhance critical thinking and maintain a dynamic interaction that leverages the strengths of both AI and human cognition. Unlike traditional cooperative models, adversarial collaboration deliberately introduces friction and critical engagement to preserve human agency and improve decision-making processes.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles, benefits, and practical applications of adversarial collaboration in AI development, focusing on how it can be used to improve code quality, security, and overall project outcomes.
