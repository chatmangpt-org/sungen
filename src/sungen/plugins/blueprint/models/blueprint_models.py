    Defines a blueprint for configuring and running commands with code generation tools in an enterprise environment.

    This class encapsulates configuration parameters for creating, editing, and managing files using AI-powered development assistants or code generation tools. It supports versioning, compliance checks, integration points, and various strategies to ensure scalability and security in development workflows.

    By defining this blueprint, organizations can enforce standardized development practices, automate workflows, ensure security compliance, and optimize resource management across projects.
