### **Introduction**

The **Ash Studio Ecosystem** is built to help developers leverage the full potential of the Ash framework, providing a structured approach to building robust, scalable, and maintainable Elixir applications. Whether you are creating APIs, managing complex data pipelines, or developing AI-driven applications, Ash Studio provides a modular, high-performance solution tailored to your needs.

### **Features**

- **Rapid Project Initialization**: Quickly set up new Ash Studio projects with minimal configuration.
- **Resource-Centric Development**: Easily generate and manage Ash resources, actions, and policies.
- **AI/ML Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly build and deploy AI models using Elixir libraries like Nx, Axon, and Bumblebee.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Handle streaming data and real-time analytics with Broadway and GenStage.
- **Advanced Data Governance**: Utilize Ash Policy Authorizer to enforce robust data governance and security.
- **Comprehensive Observability**: Monitor, log, and visualize system performance using Telemetry, Logger, and LiveDashboard.

### **Getting Started**

To get started with **Ash Studio Ecosystem**, follow these steps:

1. **Install Ash Studio CLI**:
   ```bash
   mix archive.install hex ash_studio
   ```

2. **Initialize a New Project**:
   ```bash
   ash_studio init my_project
   cd my_project
   ```

3. **Generate Resources and Actions**:
   ```bash
   ash_studio generate resource User --attributes "email:string, name:string"
   ash_studio generate action ConfirmRegistration --resource User --args "confirmation_code:string"
   ```

4. **Run Your Application**:
   ```bash
   mix phx.server
   ```

### **Usage**

**Creating a New Resource**:
```bash
ash_studio generate resource Post --attributes "title:string, body:text, published_at:datetime"
```

**Defining Custom Actions**:
```bash
ash_studio generate action PublishPost --resource Post --args "publish_date:datetime"
```

**Adding Security Policies**:
```bash
ash_studio generate policy PostPolicy --resource Post --actions "read, update"
```

### **Available Commands**

- **`init`**: Initializes a new Ash Studio project.
- **`generate resource`**: Creates a new Ash resource with specified attributes.
- **`generate action`**: Defines a custom action for an existing resource.
- **`generate policy`**: Creates a new policy module to enforce data governance.
- **`migrate`**: Manages database migrations for Ash resources.
- **`start`**: Runs the application server with the configured Ash resources.
