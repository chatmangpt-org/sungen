# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions and explanations for key terms and concepts used throughout the documentation. It serves as a quick reference to help understand the terminology related to adversarial collaboration and AI development.

- **Adversarial Collaboration**: A method of working with AI where human and AI agents engage in a dialogic exchange, often involving counter-arguments or alternative suggestions, to enhance critical thinking and maintain a dynamic interaction.

- **Epistemic Agency**: The capacity of a developer to act as a knowledgeable agent with autonomy over decisions, ensuring active participation in the decision-making process when collaborating with AI tools.

- **Zero Trust Framework**: An approach where AI-generated outputs are not automatically trusted and are subject to scrutiny, validation, and challenge to ensure accuracy and reliability.

- **Transparency and Explainability**: The practice of providing clear reasoning and context behind AI suggestions to establish a balanced trust relationship and allow for informed decision-making.

- **Dynamic Feedback Loops**: A workflow design that creates a constant feedback loop between AI and human agents, ensuring continuous refinement and validation of AI outputs against real-world constraints and requirements.
