# The Role of Epistemic Agency

## Introduction

Epistemic agency refers to the capacity of individuals to act as knowledgeable agents, making informed decisions based on their understanding and expertise. In the context of AI and coding, maintaining epistemic agency is crucial to ensure that developers remain active participants in the decision-making process, rather than passive recipients of AI-generated suggestions.

## Importance in AI Collaboration

When collaborating with AI tools, it is essential to preserve the developer's epistemic agency. This involves critically evaluating AI outputs, understanding the reasoning behind AI suggestions, and making informed decisions that align with human judgment and expertise.

## Strategies for Preserving Epistemic Agency

1. **Critical Evaluation**: Always scrutinize AI-generated outputs and validate them against your knowledge and experience.
2. **Transparency**: Ensure that AI tools provide clear explanations and reasoning for their suggestions.
3. **Active Engagement**: Engage in a dialogic exchange with AI, challenging its outputs and exploring alternative solutions.

By prioritizing epistemic agency, developers can leverage AI tools effectively while maintaining control over the coding process and ensuring high-quality outcomes.
