# Using the CONVENTIONS.md Effectively

## Introduction

The `CONVENTIONS.md` file serves as a cornerstone for maintaining consistency and quality across the codebase. It outlines the coding standards and practices that should be adhered to when using the `aider` tool for adversarial collaboration. This document is essential for ensuring that all team members are aligned in their approach to coding and AI interaction.

## Key Areas

1. **Epistemic Agency Preservation**: Emphasizes the importance of human decision-making in the coding process. The `CONVENTIONS.md` provides guidelines on how to maintain control over AI-generated suggestions.

2. **Zero Trust Framework**: Encourages skepticism towards AI outputs, ensuring that all code is thoroughly validated and challenged before integration.

3. **Adversarial Collaboration**: Details how to engage with `aider` in a way that promotes critical thinking and alternative solutions, enhancing the robustness of the final product.

## Best Practices

- **Type Safety**: Ensure that TypeScript types are used extensively to maintain strong type checks.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- **Logging and Debugging**: Maintain detailed logs to trace AI decisions and ensure transparency.

## Conclusion

By effectively utilizing the `CONVENTIONS.md`, developers can ensure a high standard of code quality and maintain a productive collaboration with AI tools. This document is a living guide that should be regularly updated to reflect new insights and practices.
