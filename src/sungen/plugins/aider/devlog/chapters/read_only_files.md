# Defining Boundaries: Read-Only Files

In any collaborative coding environment, it's crucial to establish clear boundaries to protect critical files from unintended modifications. This section outlines the importance of designating certain files as read-only and provides guidelines on how to implement this practice effectively.

## Importance of Read-Only Files

Read-only files serve as a safeguard to maintain the integrity of essential documents, such as configuration files, documentation, and other critical resources. By preventing unauthorized changes, teams can ensure that these files remain consistent and reliable throughout the development process.

## Implementing Read-Only Files

1. **Identify Critical Files**: Determine which files are essential to the project's stability and should be protected from changes.
2. **Set Permissions**: Use version control systems or file permissions to enforce read-only status on these files.
3. **Communicate Boundaries**: Clearly document which files are read-only and the rationale behind their protection to all team members.

By adhering to these guidelines, teams can maintain a structured and secure development environment, minimizing the risk of accidental or unauthorized modifications to key files.
