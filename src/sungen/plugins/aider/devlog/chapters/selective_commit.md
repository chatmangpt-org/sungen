# Committing with Control: The Selective Commit Process

In the realm of adversarial collaboration, maintaining control over the codebase is crucial. The selective commit process empowers developers to make informed decisions about which changes to integrate into the main branch. This approach ensures that only thoroughly reviewed and validated code is committed, preserving the integrity and quality of the project.

## Key Concepts

- **Selective Committing**: This involves manually reviewing changes before committing them to the repository. It allows developers to assess the impact of each change and ensure it aligns with project goals and standards.

- **Review and Validation**: Before committing, each change should undergo a rigorous review process. This includes testing for functionality, security, and performance to ensure the change is beneficial and does not introduce new issues.

- **Commit Messages**: Crafting clear and descriptive commit messages is essential. They should provide context and rationale for the changes, making it easier for team members to understand the purpose and impact of each commit.

## Best Practices

1. **Review Changes Thoroughly**: Always review the changes in detail, considering their implications on the overall project.

2. **Test Extensively**: Run all relevant tests to verify that the changes do not break existing functionality and meet performance standards.

3. **Document Rationale**: Include detailed commit messages that explain the reason for the changes and any potential impacts.

4. **Engage in Peer Reviews**: Whenever possible, have another team member review the changes to provide additional insights and catch potential issues.

By following these practices, developers can maintain a high level of control over their codebase, ensuring that only the most robust and well-considered changes are integrated.
