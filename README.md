## **Contributing to Sungen**

We welcome contributions! To contribute, set up your development environment by following these steps:

### **Prerequisites**

1. **SSH Configuration for Git**
   - [Generate an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) and [add it to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
   - Configure SSH to load your keys automatically:
    ```sh
    cat << EOF >> ~/.ssh/config
    
    Host *
      AddKeysToAgent yes
      IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain
      UseKeychain yes
      ForwardAgent yes
    EOF
    ```

2. **Docker Installation**
   - [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) to facilitate containerized development.
   - _Linux users_: Export your user ID and group ID:
    ```sh
    cat << EOF >> ~/.bashrc
    
    export UID=$(id --user)
    export GID=$(id --group)
    EOF
    ```

3. **IDE Installation**
   - Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers), or install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) for a more customized Python development experience.

### **Development Environments**

You can set up your development environment using the following methods:

1. **GitHub Codespaces**: Quickly start a Dev Container using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
2. **Dev Container with Volume**: Clone the repository into a container volume using VS Code.
3. **VS Code Local Development**: Open the repository in VS Code and use the _Dev Containers: Reopen in Container_ command.
4. **PyCharm Remote Development**: Configure Docker Compose as a remote interpreter in PyCharm.
5. **Terminal**: Use Docker Compose to manage and run development environments.

### **Development Workflow**

- Use **`poe`** to list and manage available tasks.
- Use **`poetry add {package}`** to install dependencies.
- Use **`poetry update`** to upgrade all dependencies to their latest versions.
